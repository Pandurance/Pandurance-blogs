# Welcome to the new Pandurance Racing website!

Hello world! This is our website! We have used a lot of technologies to build and run it.

## Domain

A domain is the name of a website. `pandurance.tech` is our domain name, which came from [.TECH Domains](https://get.tech).
We have a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) discount, which allowed us to enjoy one year of free trial.

## DNS

DNS is a system that takes a domain name and responds with the IP address to the domain name. For example, `pandurance.tech`
corresponds to `20.247.40.76`. You can easily find out the IP address by using `dig`:

```plaintext
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> pandurance.tech
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 889

;; ANSWER SECTION:
pandurance.tech.    3600    IN  A   20.247.40.76    // <-- IP ADDRESS!

```

Our DNS is powered by [Azure DNS Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records). It has excellent compatibility and is easy to use.

## Content

This website wasnt written from scratch, but created via the help of [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io) - a drag-and-drop content builder.
It is more time-efficient than writing the code by hand. Then, in order to load contents dynamically (like loading this blog post), we used
JavaScript. Of course, the majority of the stylesheet is provided by Bootstrap. We simply wrote another CSS file to
override some of the default colors.

Loading JavaScript efficiently is another challenge. We used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to package all our scripts
into a single "bundled" file, which would then be compressed for faster loading. Webpack has also allowed us to load scripts, stylesheets,
and even images as modules, and compresses them as well.

If you go to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/zcg-coder/pandurance-web), you will be able to find our HTML files and JavaScript script files.

## Hosting

With our content ready, we need to let the public see it. The website was originally deployed on GitHub Pages, but then
we switched to [Azure](https://azure.com) for higher bandwidth. The site is hosted as an [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static). The project
tracker is hosted on an Azure VM, running [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org). Both of the servers are connected to our Azure DNS Zone.

The blog contents are hosted on another GitHub repository ([here](https://github.com/zcg-coder/pandurance-blogs)), which is loaded dynamically using JavaScript.

## SSL

To connect to our hosting servers securely, the connection needs to be encrypted. SSL certificates are used to encrypt
connections and ensure that data is not being overheard or modified during transfers. The project tracker subdomain uses
a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) free SSL certificate, while our main website uses an SSL certificate provided by Azure.

## Conclusion

This website is the first we have created. We are very happy that the process has been smooth, and hope that the site can tell everyone more about us in the future.
