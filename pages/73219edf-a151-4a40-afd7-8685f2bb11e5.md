# Welcome to the new Pandurance Racing website!

Hello world! We have just got a new website. We have used a lot of technologies to build and run it.

## Domain

The domain basically means the name of the website. `pandurance.tech` is our domain name, which is from [.TECH Domains](https://get.tech).
We have a [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) discount, which lets us get it for free, for 1 year.

## DNS

DNS is a system that takes a domain name and responds with the IP address to the domain name. For example, `pandurance.tech`
corresponds to `20.247.40.76`. You can easily find out the IP address by using `dig`:

```plaintext
; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> pandurance.tech
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 889
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:

;; ANSWER SECTION:
pandurance.tech.    3600    IN  A   20.247.40.76    // <-- IP ADDRESS!

```

Our DNS is powered by [Azure DNS Zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records). It has excellent compatibility and is very easy to use.

## Content

We didn't write the website from scratch, but used [Bootstrap Studio](https://bootstrapstudio.io) to do so. The drag-and-drop content builder
is much better than writing code by hand. Then, to load contents dynamically (like loading this blog post), we used
JavaScript. Of course, the majority of the stylesheet is provided by Bootstrap. We simply wrote another CSS file to
override some of the default colors.

Loading JavaScript efficiently is also very challenging. Therefore, we used [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org) to package all our scripts
into a single "bundled" file, which is then compressed for faster loading. Webpack also allowed us to load scripts, stylesheets,
and even images as modules, and does compression on them as well.

If you go to [our GitHub page](https://github.com/zcg-coder/pandurance-web), you can find our HTML files and JavaScript script files.

## Hosting

With our content ready, we need to let the public see it. The website was originally deployed on GitHub Pages, but then
we switched to [Azure](https://azure.com) for higher bandwidth. The site is hosted as an [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static). The project
tracker is hosted on an Azure VM, running [OpenProject](https://www.openproject.org). Both of the servers are connected to our Azure DNS Zone.

The blog contents are hosted on another GitHub repository ([here](https://github.com/zcg-coder/pandurance-blogs)), which is loaded dynamically using JavaScript.

## SSL

To connect to our hosting servers securely, the connection needs to be encrypted. SSL certificates are used to encrypt
connections and ensure that data is not being overheard or modified during transfers. The project tracker subdomain uses
a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) free SSL certificate, while our main website uses an SSL certificate provided by Azure.

## Conclusion

This website is one of the first websites we have created. We are very happy that the process has been going smoothly (
in fact, much more smoothly than ever), and hope that the site can tell everyone more about us in the future.
