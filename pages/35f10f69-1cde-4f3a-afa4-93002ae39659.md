# The first round of the competition is a wrap!

In the Hong Kong and Macau Regional Development class compeition, our team managed to achieve a result of fifth place in the pool of 24 teams, securing a spot in the Professional Class competition.  We are determined to get a podium in the Professional Class competition and advance to the world finals!

## 24 Aug

The competition began on 24 Aug, at the Hong Kong Productivity Council. We set up a "pit display" (a special stall to showcase our car design and team management) and got ready for racing. In the afternoon, we got to witness our cars in action for the first time! There was also a special judging session on our pit display. The day ended with a verbal presentation, at 17:00 UTC+8.

## 25 Aug

The second day included a series of knockout races. Our car performed way better than expected, and eventually even got into the top four. 

## Conclusion

Although only at the fifth place, we never expected ourselves to achieve this high. Also, we had tight timeframes and packed schedules during the summer break, making this even harder. However, thanks to our great dedication and skills, we were still able to make this.

Next time, we will employ better team management tools and improve our presentation skills. We are also improving our car to avoid some mistakes we made, like sticking A4 paper on the car body. We will all aim higher for the next time!
