# Training Session 3 is Completed!

Today at HKPC, we learnt more about wheel design and marketing concepts, like equations to calculate wheel physics to
make the car run faster and more efficiently.

- $$\text{Energy released by CO2} = \text{Kinetic Energy of car} + \text{rotational energy of wheels}$$

- Linear kinetic energy
    $$E_{linear} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2$$
    Where:
    
    - $E_{linear}$ = Linear kinetic energy 
    - $m$ = Mass
    - $v$ = Linear velocity

- Rotational energy
    $$E_{rot} = \frac{1}{2}Iw^2$$
    - If $E_{rot}$ is larger in value, it is bad
    - To reduce Erot, reduce $Iw^2$


- Reducing w:
    $$w = \text{Angular velocity} = \frac{v}{r}$$

    $$\downarrow w \uparrow r$$ ($v$ is fixed)

    Where:
    - $w$ = Angular velocity 
    - $v$ = Linear velocity 
    - $r$ = Radius 

- $$I = \text{Moment of inertia}$$

    $$I = \Sigma mr^2$$
 
    Where:
    - $I$ = Moment of inertia
    - $\Sigma$ = Summation (add everything)
    - $m$ = Mass
    - $r$ = Radius

We also learnt marketing concepts like SWOT analysis, namely "Strength, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats", which
helps us anaylyze our team aspects to maximise our strengths and improve our weaknesses. We also learnt more about the
4Ps of marketing, the 4Ps stand for **P**roduct, **P**rice, **P**lace and **P**romotion.
